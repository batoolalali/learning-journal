computers help us in thinkink by solving math problems for an example.
the computer is a system that take inputs, storage, processe and give outputs.

## Inputs 
are things that make computers make stuff; like mouse, keyboard ... ect.

## Sorage
the computer memory

## Processe
take info from memory and do some algorithms in them.

## output
What computer's designed to do

computer works on ones and zeroes, inside it are wires and circuts

elecrical signals translated as (1, yes, on, true) or (0, no, off, false)

## number systems

### decmal 
(from 0 to 9)

### binary
1,0

32 wires can store from 0 to over 4 billion (2^32)
