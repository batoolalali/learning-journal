## What is JS?
A script is a series of instructions that the computer follows step-by-step to achives goals

## writing a script:
1. state your goal and then list the
tasks.
2. Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps.
   - Defining the tasks: it can represented using flowchart 
   - Design the script: Each task needs a sequence of steps, Translate these steps into lines.
   - Code each step: write every step in a language that computer can understand.

## To start scripting with a language you have to learn about:

- Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand.
- Syntax: How you put those words together.

P.S **THINK** like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you solve them.

 ## **An expression** evaluates into a single value.
  - Assign a variable value.  ( var a = 'color' ;)
  - Use two or more values to return a single value. (var b = a + 3 ;)
  - Comparison oprators. Compare two values and return true or false. (var Bo= 0 || a;)
  - Logical opratora . ombine expressions and return true or fa1se. (var bo = a<0 && a>6;)
  - string opretor. combaine two strings. ( var str= 'hello' + 'world'; )
  - Mathmatical Op.

  A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

## Function 
function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function
