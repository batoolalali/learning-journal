
**Evaluated** 
compare a value with what is expected to be.

## Logical  operater:
((value1 < value2 )  && (value1 != 1))

## Comparision opratings:
( value1 < value2 )

## Loops
Loops check conditions, if condition is true a code block will be run; then the condition will be checked again, if it's again true the block will be run again.untile condiction returns false.


- for : if you need to run the code specific number of time
- while : if you don't know how many times the code should run.
- do...while : it's similar to while, but the code will run one more time than while.


for (i=0; i<8; i++)

{

sum=sum+i;

}


while (i<=n)
{

sum=sum+i;
i++;

}

do {

sum=sum+i;
i++;

} while (i<n)
