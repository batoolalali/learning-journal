*Version Control* recordes changes which makes rectifing mistakes with files easily, give teams members informations about others actions with files,allows to create mirrored repositories as data backups, so server can replace any lost information if any error happen, git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots, so Git keeps tracking changes.
Git has three states; committed, modified and staged.
After readings I learnt about some commands;
* git config --list (to check settings)
* git add . (open the repo in VS)
* git commit -m " any message or comment" (makes initial commit)
* git clone URL 
* git status (check file status)
* git remote -v (give the origin )
