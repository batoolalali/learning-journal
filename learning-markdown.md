**Markdown** is how to style text on the web by easy syntax, as we did before we style the font, made headers, changed font styles and includes hyperlink and images to our pages.
In this lab I learnt how to add a **Blockquotes** like this; >Life without despair is a life without hope!
and I learnt how to make a code with highlighting syntax
```css
p { color: blue;}
```
I also learnt how to create lists and tables
