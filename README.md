# learning-journal
Give Myself a learning challenge: Figure out how to publish a GitHub Pages web site, to use as a learning journal.
It's an easy syntax for formatting plain text.

We can change the font *style* and I learnt how to create an inline link. [help!](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

The third thing I learnt it is who to make a list of elements in many ways:
- Unordereds.
- Order lists.
- Nested Lists.
- Tasks lists.
There is an exmple of Tasks lists.
