# learning-journal
I Give Myself a learning challenge: Figure out how to publish a GitHub Pages web site, to use as a learning journal.
It's an easy syntax for formatting plain text. 

Our Journal has many topics:

* [learning-markdown](https://batoolalali.github.io/learning-journal/learning-markdown)
* [text-editor](https://batoolalali.github.io/learning-journal/text-editor)
* [Setup and Documentation](https://batoolalali.github.io/learning-journal/Read03)


# Heading Format:
##### By Using hashtag add one to six to choose the heading!
We can change the font *style* and I learnt how to create an inline link. [help!](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

The third thing I learnt it is who to make a list of elements in many ways:
- Unordereds.
- Order lists.
- Nested Lists.
- Tasks lists.
There is an exmple of Tasks lists.
- [x] Code 101
- [ ] code 201

The most fun part is adding emojis :relieved: :thumbsup:
