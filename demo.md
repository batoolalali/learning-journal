# learning-journal
I Give Myself a learning challenge: Figure out how to publish a GitHub Pages web site, to use as a learning journal.
It's an easy syntax for formatting plain text. 

Our Journal has many topics:

* [learning-markdown](https://github.com/batoolalali/learning-journal/learning-markdown)
* [text-editor](https://github.com/batoolalali/learning-journal/text-editor)
* [Setup and Documentation](https://github.com/batoolalali/learning-journal/Read03)
