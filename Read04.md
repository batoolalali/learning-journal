                        The purpose of the <b>hgroup</b>
                            element is to group together a

                            <b>h6</b> elements so that they are
                            treated as one single heading.

                        Every HTML element can carry the id attribute, also carry a class attribute.he only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.

                        Block elements will always
                        appear to start on a new line in
                        the browser window. These are
                        known as block level elements.

                        appear to continue on the
