Choosing a text editor is a personal choise depances on which one I feel comfortable while I using it, the diffrents between text editors come from code completion,
syntax, highlighting; and the editor's, the available extensions.
 Code completion is an important feature to choose an editor; it helps to complete the code by giving suggestions and helps to keep writing in the write syntax.
 Ability to write HTML and CSS is also a benifit feature so syntax highlighting is benifit too; it changes the code colors to make it easier to finds errors.
 The theme is helpful to make coding comfortable.
